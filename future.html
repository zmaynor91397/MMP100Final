		<H1>How will mass surveillance effect the future?</H1>
		<p>
		It has become clear that corporations are fighting to take advantage of our compromised privacy rights.
		<br>
		<br>
		The government is also trying to undermine the people and work with corporations to control how privacy is distributed	
		<br>
		<br>
		As time goes by, the general public will probably accept this, and this will only get worse.
