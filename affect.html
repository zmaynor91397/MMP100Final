		<H1>How has mass surveillance effected our lives?</H1>
		<p>
		Ever since the infastructure of the government's mass surveillance programs have been revealed. Their attempt to be transparent has only showed how this hinders law enforcement.
		<br>
		<br>
		It has led to a lot of racial profiling.
		<br>
		<br>
		Many people have been wrongly accused for terrorism.
		<br>
		<br>
		These effects have shown that the effectivness of mass surveillance doesn't justify the whole operation.
